Two Phases of AI(1.Machine Learning 2.Deep Learning 3.Natural Language Processs 4.Time Series Analysis)
1.Model Creation(Learning Process)(Phase-1 Learning Phase)
Model creation is like instagram filter where is nose,lip and mouth in insta where to fix the glass in face.

2.Deployment/Production/Implement(Phase-2)
Call to action.Automaticall glass will fix in eyes.

AI Phase-1.Model Creation(Learning Process)(Phase-1 Learning Phase)
Data collection ---> Data Preprocessing ---> Input/Output Split --->Split Train  and Test --->  1.Train set---> Model Creation 
                                                                     Split Train  and Test--->  2.Test  set--->Evaluation  Metrics
                                                                                                2.Test  set ---> Save the best Model
           
1.Data collection-Collectin Datas
2.Data Preprocessing (Only particular important Data.Eg:Input and Output) 
3.Input/Output Split
Assigning Input and output in individual Vraiable                                                                      
4.Split Train  and Test(Train (Eg:Revision Exam) and Test (Eg:Board Exam(Final)) 
Train Set is to creat a model 
Test Set is Evaluation metrics,Final one and Save the best method(Output)

AI Phase-2.Deployment

1.Load the saved Model(Where we get in Learning Phase as Final Output)
2.Get Inputs
3.Prediction
4.Call to action
