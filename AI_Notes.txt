Artificial(oposite of natural) Intelligence(Brain)
We will create artificial brain(Maths Logics) to make prediction
1.Elements of AI-1.Machine Learning 2.Deep learning  3.Natural  language Processing 4 .Time Series Analysis 5.Data Science

2.Comparison between Human parts VS AI
1.Eye-Computer vision
2.Brain-Deep learning Neural Network
3.Language-Natural Language Processing(Eg.Alexa)
4.Heart-Processor.

3.AI-Hiarachy
1.Machine Learning 2.Deep learning  3.Natural  language Processing 4 .Time Series Analysis-This four comes under Prediction
5.5.Data Science-comes under Analysis part

4.Domain Selection:
Input:Domain
1.Number-Machine Learning(Eg:Excels Datas)
2.Image&Number-Deep learning(Eg:Flowers(Image) To Predict,Dogs(Images) to predict)
3.Text-Natural Langauage processing(Eg:Amazon Reviews,Flipkart Rewiews,Online Reviews(To predict positive or negative))
4.Date-Time Series Analysis(Eg:Predict to ozone value for future days)
Machine learning,Deep Learning,Natural Langaugae processing not based on time 
but Time series Analysis is completely Based time,Date,Year)
5.Data science -In business analysis we dont need prediction we need analysis and Statistics.

5.Relationship between AI and Python.
AI is Maths,Python is calculator to used  for AI
Anaconda is distributer  the software of Jupyter and spyter etc
Jupyter and spyter and all softer under Anaconda is IDE-Integrated Development Environment

6.Heart Of AI is Information Data Dataset

7.How Machine Learning differs from Deep Learning?
There is a Brain Activity  in DL & No Brain Activity in ML.

8.What is assigned operators
It assign value of right hand side value to left hand side.
A=8 Means Right hand side value is assigned to left hand side(one equal)
a==1 means comparison

9.Programmimg is used for Do a task

Anaconda Prompt

Python-Alphabets-Syntex,Grammer-Procedure
Nameerror-1.Spell mistake,2.We didnt define in memory
Syntex error-Check the bracket is closed

10.control structure:
1.If-Else 2.If-elif 3.For Loop 4.While Loop

OOPS-Object Oriented Programming System(Language)
Class and Function comes under OOPS Concept

In our return statement we must need variable
In Function Return statement is must without return Statement Function will not execute the output.
Using function reduce the code writing

#def BMI(num1,num2):Inside the parenthesis we have to give variable means thats is parenthesis or arguments or input passing are same 
parameter means input we are passing in it
