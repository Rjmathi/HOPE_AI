Machine Learning-Algorithms
1.Regresssion Algorithm(Low Error)
2.Classification Algorithm

1.Support vector Machine 2.Decision Tree 3.Random Forest.These three supports for both Regression and Classification Algorithm

1.Regression Algorithm
1.Linear Algorithm 2.Multiple Linear Regression 3.Polynomial Regression.These three purely supports for Regression Algorithm

2.Classification Algorithm
1.Logistic Algorithm 2.Navies Bayes 3.KNN .These is for Classification Algorithm.

There are lots of basic Algorithm comes under Regression and classification.

1.Simple Linear Regression-Future Prediction
Simple(One I/P,One O/P)
Linear -Slope(Sland Slope(/))
Regression-Decimal
Y=wX+B
Straight Line Equation Y=mX+C
Which x is input(Independent),Y is Output(Dependent/Response Variable)
y=O/p(Which forms Straight line by adding all data points)
m=Slope=dy/dx=Weight (Which says about constant distance between two data points)
but in ML that M is w(Weight),C is Bias so B(Y=WX+b)
M is constant distance between two data points in inputs(X axis)
X=I/p(If input change,Output also changes accordingly)
C=Bias=intercept=Starting of straight line=initial Value=Minimal Value 
W(Slope) means in which ratio between two point in x axis is increased
B(Bias)Inial Value/Minimal Value/Origin (Starting point in X axis)

Validating Parameters(To test the finded model-15 Parameters)
Vlidating Parameter:
1.Sum Square Error(SSE) or Residual Sum of Square(RSS)(Sigma value is lower)
2.Sum of Square Regression(SSR) or Explained Sum of Square(ESS)(Sigma value is Higher)
3.Sum of Square Total(SST)(Sigma value is lower)
SST=SSR+SSE
4.R Square(R^2)
RSqaure=SSR/SST
RSqaure Lies between 0 to 1
1 means Better Performance
0 means poor performance
