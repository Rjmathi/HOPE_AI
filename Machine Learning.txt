Stage-1
Based on client data and requirement,If it is
Input:Domain
1.Numbers-Machine Learning(Eg:Excels Datas)
2.Image&Number-Deep learning(Eg:Flowers(Image) To Predict,Dogs(Images) to predict)
3.Text-Natural Langauage processing(Eg:Amazon Reviews,Flipkart Rewiews,Online Reviews(To predict positive or negative))
4.Date-Time Series Analysis(Eg:Predict to ozone value for future days)
Machine learning,Deep Learning,Natural Langaugae processing not based on time 
but Time series Analysis is completely Based time,Date,Year)
5.Data science -In business analysis we dont need prediction we need analysis and Statistics.
1.Machine Learning
Stage-2 Learning Selection 
Type-1.Supervised Learning(Monitering)
Type-2.Unsupervised Learning
Type-3.Semisupervised Learning

Type-1.Supervised Learning(Monitering)
Requirement is very clear and Input and Output are present and well defined that is called Supervised Learning
One input or 100(Multiple)input or Variables or Features or Independent
Output or Target or Response Variable or label
Type-2.Unsupervised Learning(Clustering)
Requirement is not clear and input are not clear,there is no output variable,
unsupervised data is helpful to target marketing.
Unsupervised Learning is means clustering and its helpful for Target Marketing.
eg:Google lens ,if u upload any image ,google gives whatever matches with uploaded image 
Type-3.Semisupervised Learning
Semi means Half
Semisupervised is half of supervised and half of Unsupervised
Input available ,Output layer half not available,or sometimes complete output is not available.Requirement is clear
we need to change semisupervised datas to Supervised Datas-Step 1


Stage-3 Supervised(Regression or Classification)
This stage is only applicable for Supervised Learning 
The given problem is comes under Supervised learning only then only we will goes to Regression and Classification
1.Classification-Classifying the output Based on the input Parameter 
we are going to predict output, so the output column is in words then it is Classification,
that is categorical data(Eg:yes/no,Dog/Cat,House/not House
2.If the Output is in NumericalValue or Continuous Values.Continous Value means its in Decimal Value(23.4,45.5,43.9,32.5).
We need to find that is Classification or Regression means we need to see and check the output.
Final-If the output is in Words then it is Classification if the output is in NUmerical then that is Regression.

2.Deep learning-Image&Number
Type-1.Supervised Learning(Monitering)
Type-2.Unsupervised Learning(Rare case in Deep learning)
Type-3.Semisupervised Learning

3.Natural Langauage processing-Text
Type-1.Supervised Learning
Type-2.Unsupervised Learning(Rare case in Natural Language Processing learning)
Type-3.Semisupervised Learning

4.Time Series Analysis-Date
Type-1.Supervised Learning(Only Supports Regression)
Type-2.Unsupervised Learning(Rare case in Time Series Analysis )
Type-3.Semisupervised Learning
